# Steps
1) Create `docs/kb/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with:
   - Title, Source (URL if available), and a short Summary.
   - **Quotations** block with exact quotes (<= 10 lines each) and locations.
   - **Takeaways for this repo**.
2) Append a link to this note under the relevant topic in `docs/AGENT_KB.md`.
3) **Print a change summary**.
