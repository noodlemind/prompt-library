description: 'Append vetted links to docs/AGENT_KB.md under the right topic'
---

# Steps
1) If `docs/AGENT_KB.md` exists, append links under the requested topic; else create it with "Allowed domains" and "Canonical links".
2) Do not fetch content. Record links + one-line notes (why relevant).
3) **Print a change summary**.
