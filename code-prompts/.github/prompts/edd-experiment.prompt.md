# Steps
1) Create or update `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.
2) For each attempt: **PLAN** → **Patch** (diff) → **Verify** (commands or TODOs) → **Result** → **Learnings** → **Next Step**.
3) Stop after two failed attempts without new info; add **one** question to the issue’s `## Missing` and stop.
4) **Print a change summary**.
