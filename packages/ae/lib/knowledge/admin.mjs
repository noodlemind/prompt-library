 * The CLI NEVER git-commits the product repo — these files land in the

 * docs/knowledge/learnings/ — nothing anywhere reads that directory back
 * into the store, so a foreign copy (another machine's commit, or a
 * hand-planted file) is read-only reference until a future

 * `<domain>/<slug>` matches ANY of three things: a CURRENT store learning
 * that is now inactive, an id the caller explicitly names via `retiredIds` —
 * full-reset callers (`purge --all`, `rebuild --yes`) capture the store's id
 * list BEFORE wiping it and pass it here, since after the wipe those ids no
 * longer exist anywhere for the "current store" half of the check to match —
 * or an id THIS pass just excluded as secret-shaped (`skippedIds`, below): an
 * ACTIVE learning that turns secret-shaped is excluded from the write and the
 * INDEX, and without also sweeping it here its previous clean mirror copy
 * would linger forever, out of sync with both. Anything else (an id none of
 * the three lists names — genuinely foreign, or simply never mirrored) is
 * left untouched.
 *
 * Every learning slated for the mirror (verbatim text or INDEX entry) is
 * secret-scanned first: a hit is excluded from BOTH the `.md` write and the
 * INDEX entry list entirely — a skipped learning is invisible in the mirror,
 * not just missing its file body — and counted in `skipped` with a logged
 * warning (best-effort screening per design §11).

/**
 * Absorb hand edits to the learnings store: a human can edit or delete a
 * `learnings/<domain>/<slug>.md` file directly in the store repo, bypassing
 * every CLI write path entirely. Every mutation entry point calls this FIRST
 * (advisory, best effort — see each call site's try/catch) so a human's edit
 * is captured and given its own `human edit: <ids>` commit before the entry
 * point's own mutation runs. The motivation is applyOps's failure-path
 * `git reset --hard`: without absorbing first, a dirty tree sitting through
 * that reset would silently destroy an uncommitted hand edit along with the
 * partial op-write it's cleaning up.
 *
 * Non-creating: a storeless workspace or a store with no git repo returns the
 * same empty result as an already-clean tree — this function never
 * materializes the store. Only `learnings/<domain>/<slug>.md` entries are
 * absorbed; untracked/modified non-learning store files (config.json,
 * stale.json, INDEX.md) are left alone for the next normal commit's own
 * `git add -A` to pick up.
 *
 * UNTRACKED LEARNING FILES ARE HAND EDITS TOO (P1). A learning file planted
 * directly in the store — `?? learnings/<domain>/<slug>.md`, or the bucket
 * equivalent — is ACTIVE, retrievable content the moment it lands
 * (listLearnings reads the tree, not the git index), yet it was skipped here
 * as "untracked/other" and then swept wholesale into store history by the
 * next transaction's `git add -A` — INCLUDING a transaction whose own op set
 * was rejected. Never validated, never secret-scanned, never rendered by the
 * sole writer, and recorded with whatever provenance its author typed.
 * Untracked learning paths are therefore absorbed through this exact same
 * path as a modified one: snapshot-evidenced, secret-scanned, byte-cap
 * logged, re-serialized by `serializeLearning`, and stamped `source: human`
 * — the honest provenance for a file a person put in the store by hand.
 * `-uall` is required for that: the default `-unormal` collapses a brand-new
 * `learnings/<domain>/` into a single directory entry that matches no
 * learning path shape.
 *
 * A SYMLINK AT A LEARNING PATH IS NEVER ABSORBED. Every read and write in this
 * loop goes through fs-safe.mjs (`assertNoSymlinkAncestors` + `readFileNoFollow`
 * on the way in, `writeFileContained` on the way out), because a planted
 * symlink is otherwise followed in BOTH directions — reading an arbitrary
 * outside file into store history and a workspace teaching snapshot, then
 * overwriting that outside file with a canonically serialized learning. Such a
 * path is refused with a logged note, never followed.
 *
 * THAT COVERS A SYMLINK AT A LEARNING FILE, AND ONLY THAT. A symlink at a
 * store-owned DIRECTORY (`learnings/`, a domain directory, `branches/`, a
 * bucket, a bucket's learnings tree) never reaches this loop at all:
 * LEARNING_FILE_RE matches `…/<domain>/<slug>.md`, so a directory plant yields
 * no entry to quarantine, and every learning it hides looks to absorb like it
 * was simply never there. Worse, absorb would then read the resulting `D`
 * entries as a human deleting every learning at once and record a governance
 * `retire` for each. That whole class is handled UPSTREAM instead, before this
 * function is ever called: `withStoreTransaction` (store.mjs) sweeps the owned
 * directory shapes under the lock — quarantine, restore from the last commit,
 * then refuse the run — and `commitStore` refuses to stage while one stands.
