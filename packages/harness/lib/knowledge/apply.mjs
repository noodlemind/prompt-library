 * unaffected.
 *
 * Two lanes, deliberately different:
 *   - LIVE human lane (`humanPresent: true`, set only by `runRemember` —
 *     remember.mjs): bypasses this gate ENTIRELY, same trust plane as
 *     `approve`. The human acting right now IS the authority; there is
 *     nothing to prove recent against — they are the live source of the
 *     decision. This does NOT touch the promoted-target block, which stays
 *     absolute regardless (checked unconditionally, before any reteach logic
 *     ever runs).
 *   - MODEL lane (an unattended `consolidate --apply` — a model copying a
 *     candidates-packet episode verbatim, or a human running the CLI
 *     directly against an ops JSON): episode `date` is day-granular
 *     (YYYY-MM-DD, an episode file's own frontmatter), but a governance
 *     record's `at` is now a full ISO-8601 timestamp (see
 *     lifecycle.mjs/apply.mjs/admin.mjs's appendGovernance call sites) — a
 *     day-granular episode can prove it happened on a LATER calendar day
 *     than the record, but can never prove it happened later WITHIN the same
 *     day the record was written (readGovernance also tolerates a legacy
 *     plain-date `at`, in which case the same day-string comparison still
 *     applies). So the model lane requires the episode's day to be STRICTLY
 *     newer than the record's day: `episode day > record day` passes,
 *     `episode day === record day` now FAILS (previously a same-day tie
 *     favored the override — that same-day allowance is what let a
 *     same-day, unattended re-application of stale-but-authentic evidence
 *     silently overturn a same-day veto). An episode with no parseable date
 *     fails closed either way — never counts as recent enough to override a
 *     recorded human decision.
