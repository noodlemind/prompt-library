# Learning operations

The agent authors the durable claim and chooses an approved destination. Harness owns representation, publication, evidence bindings, indexing, caps and replay. Learning and consolidation records remain outside the work contract.

## Publication

Write a decision under `.harness/decisions/` and call `harness compound --plan <path> --learning-decision <file> --json`:

```json
{
  "operation": "accepted-boundary-lesson",
  "decision": "publish",
  "scope": "private",
  "rationale": "The verified work demonstrated a reusable boundary.",
  "title": "Preserve publication identity during recovery",
  "category": "reliability",
  "tags": ["publication", "recovery"],
  "body": "Evidence, root cause, correction, prevention and applicability."
}
```

Scopes: `private` uses the product solution store; `global` uses the selected Copilot home's knowledge; `ship-set-proposal` saves a dormant proposal under the workspace's `.harness/proposals/`. It never activates a primitive or edits the shipped corpus. Use a wider scope only within the applicable approval contract. To record no durable learning, submit `decision: "no-learning"` with an operation and rationale.

Harness requires current passed verification and required review coverage. It reports the actual published path, content identity, indexing result and learning record. Same identity/content/destination/proof replays; different content, destination or proof conflicts. Retry an interrupted operation with the same input. Changed publication bytes are a conflict; missing accepted bytes can be recovered. Unrestored shared retrieval state requires reconciliation through `harness index` before recovery. Use the returned diagnostics; do not claim a partial rollback succeeded.

`--dry-run` validates without publication. Optional authored `trigger` and `claim` fields are supported. Investigation capture without passed work uses the existing `compound --insight` lane and remains an insight.

## Consolidation

`harness consolidate --candidates --json` returns a persisted schema-2 frozen packet. Read its clusters and learning records, then supply semantic ops:

```json
{
  "schema": 2,
  "packet": "<returned packet ID>",
  "operation": "accepted-claim-consolidation",
  "attempt": 1,
  "ops": [{
    "op": "ADD",
    "domain": "reliability",
    "slug": "publication-identity",
    "trigger": "Recovering a publication operation",
    "body": "The accepted publication identity remains bound to its content and evidence.",
    "reason": "Nearest existing claims do not cover this boundary.",
    "episodes": [{"id": "<returned episode ID>"}]
  }]
}
```

`ADD` needs domain, slug, trigger and body. `STRENGTHEN` needs target. `SUPERSEDE` needs target plus replacement fields. `MERGE` needs targets plus replacement fields. `NOOP` needs its evidence and preferably a rationale. Every op selects nonempty episode IDs; optional authored `plan` references retain the legacy plan-link contract. Harness expands paths, hashes and kinds. Category grouping is a hint; semantic grouping remains the agent's decision.

Run `consolidate --apply --ops <file> --dry-run --json` for the same schema, bytes, cap, lint and governance validation used by apply. Dry-run spends no attempt. The returned `diagnostics` and `retry` fields own repair eligibility. An eligible failure permits the returned second attempt; terminal failures and completed operations do not. Reusing one attempt with different content conflicts. The receipt is committed with the store's effects, so interrupted outer bookkeeping recovers without consuming episodes twice.

Existing schema-1 proposals remain readable through the existing validator; new workflows use frozen packets. Existing knowledge modes and explicit human approval for suggest mode or authority expansion remain unchanged. Standing human retire, dispute and promotion decisions remain authoritative. A stale packet needs fresh source inspection and a new operation, not a blind replay. After applying a bounded packet, request another; omission counts preserve the remaining debt.
