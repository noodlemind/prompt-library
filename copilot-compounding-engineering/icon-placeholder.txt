Icon Placeholder

For the VSIX package, you'll need to create a 128x128 PNG icon named "icon.png".

Suggested icon design:
- A compound/layered design representing multiple agents working together
- Colors: Blue/Purple gradient (matches VS Code/Copilot theme)
- Include elements suggesting:
  - Multiple layers/agents (circles or hexagons)
  - Code/engineering symbols
  - Growth/compound interest visualization

You can create this using:
- Canva (free)
- Figma (free)
- GIMP (free, open source)
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop

Icon requirements for VS Code extensions:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG (not SVG)
- No transparency issues
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes

Temporary workaround:
Remove the "icon" line from package.json if you want to build without an icon.
